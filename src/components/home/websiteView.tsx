                                Hey Ho, I&apos;m Alex, a passionate software
                                developer with a deep affinity for everything
                                related to backend development. My journey into
                                the world of computer science began early in my
                                school days, where I discovered a fascination
                                for creative problem-solving - a contrast to
                                mathematics, which is also a great passion of
                                mine.
                            </p>
                            <br />
                            <p>
                                After graduating from high school, I initially
                                started studying mathematics but soon realized
                                that my true calling was in computer science.
                                During my studies, I gained experience in
                                various areas of software development, such as
                                testing and project management. However, my
                                heart beat stronger for software development
                                itself, which I have now been doing
                                professionally since the end of 2021.
                            </p>
                            <br />
                            <p>
                                My main interest is in backend development.
                                Here, I am fascinated by everything around data,
                                databases, and web APIs. My drive is the
                                continuous learning and deepening of my skills,
                                particularly in C# and the ASP.NET Core
                                environment.

                                realized. These range from learning projects to
                                real, practical applications. My goal is to
                                become an expert in the field of backend
                                development â€“ a long but exciting journey on
                                which I am constantly educating myself.

                                creativity in my private life. I program a lot

                                and am trying my hand at music production. I am
